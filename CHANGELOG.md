# Changelog

## 0.5.2 (local fork; not published)

- Visible Chrome windows now use the native window viewport instead of a fixed 1024×640 emulated viewport, fixing blank areas after window resizing. Background mode retains its deterministic viewport.
- Added an opt-in real desktop regression that grows and shrinks the native window and checks page layout plus batch reuse.

## 0.5.1 (local fork; not published)

- Default navigation reuses one browser/context and working tab; concurrent batch starts are serialized.
- Unfinished input or paused tasks are preserved and return session_in_use instead of being overwritten.
- Additional independent browsers require explicit new_instance=true (library: newInstance). Maximum remains four when explicitly requested.
- Changes to credential/recording boundaries require closing the existing session first.

## 0.5.0 (local fork; not published)

Browser update: use the installed Google Chrome by default with an isolated temporary profile. Removed automatic Chromium downloads and the browser-install script. Optional executable-path override supports nonstandard installations.

Launcher update: generated configurations resolve Node through the Agent PATH using a shell wrapper, with missing/old Node installation guidance; no machine-specific Node executable is embedded.

Breaking changes:

- All ordinary text comes from the host agent. Removed text-model SDKs, provider detection and keyword fallback.
- Required inference configuration is now `JEV_API_URL` plus `JEV_API_KEY`; optional `JEV_MODEL`. Unified Bearer Decisions transport; old provider-specific wrappers are removed.
- Persistent MCP sessions add `jev_resume`, `jev_continue`, `jev_read`, and `jev_close`. `jev_navigate` can return `needs_input` or `paused`.
- One-shot CLI exits 3 when host text is needed; its session is closed. Library callers may provide `textProvider`.
- Per-session serialization, single-use input IDs, pinned target validation, cumulative task budgets, idle cleanup and process shutdown handling.
- Retained secret source checks and credential-session redaction/screenshot suppression.
- Missing token accounting and all monetary estimates are null, not guessed zero-cost values.
- Added local browser/MCP integration tests and configuration generators for Codex, Qoder and Claude Code.
- Local package is private to prevent accidental publication under the upstream name.

## Unreleased

- Form controls now resolve an accessible name (AccName 1.2 precedence: `aria-labelledby` refs, `aria-label`, all associated native labels via the `.labels` API, then placeholder and title). Plain `<label for>` login forms no longer drop out of the action space, which previously made their inputs invisible and untypeable (#1).
- A successful type action now records a truthful outcome (`typed into "Username"; no visible page change`) instead of `no visible change`, so the stuck watcher no longer misreads a filled field as a no-op. Repeat recovery now keys off machine state (a repeated action whose only effect was the fill, or a genuine no-op) instead of matching the display string, and no longer terminates on a `done` alternate with negligible probability.
- Native `<select>` dropdowns are now selected by DOM option index instead of by label string, with each option's live index carried alongside its label. Blank options are filtered from the model's list without shifting the indexes used for selection, and a scrubbed or truncated label can never become the selection key.
- Password fill for logins: the model never sees or types the password. Delivery is CLI `--password-file <path|->` (stdin supported), MCP `password_file` (one-shot file directly inside `~/.jev-browser/handoff`, validated: owner, mode 0600, single link, no symlinks, unlinked at run start), or MCP `password_env` (only `JEV_PASSWORD_*` names, rejected before lookup). Fills are bound to an exact trusted origin (`JEV_BROWSER_PASSWORD_ORIGIN`, `--password-origin`), and the type/origin check and the fill run as a single in-page task on the resolved element, so no navigation or DOM swap can interleave. Fills never submit. Echoes of the value (raw, percent-encoded, form-encoded, HTML-entity, markdown-escaped, whitespace- and zero-width-normalized, aria-YAML-escaped) are redacted from every model-facing state, trace, error, URL, and payload, including values a page reflects into labels, attributes, console output, or URLs after the fill; the task string itself is scrubbed the same way. On credential runs each capture window is sized to the longest representation of the value so redaction always sees the whole echo before any display cap, dropdowns select by DOM index instead of label, secrets containing CR/LF or control characters (or whose echo-normalized form falls below the safe redaction length) are rejected up front, the library path validates the secret the same way the CLI and MCP adapters do, a failed handoff read only unlinks the file it actually pinned, and a rejected direct-library call no longer leaks the deadline timer or the caller's abort listener. Ordinary runs skip password inputs during extraction (a textbox or searchbox role on a password field does not change that), so the feature costs nothing when unused. Credential runs refuse recording, any nonempty `DEBUG`/`DEBUG_FILE`/`PWDEBUG` (including `PWDEBUG=0`), and suppress the final screenshot. The redaction marker is held to a postcondition on every call (no representation of the value may survive in the output, including reassembled across adjacent markers or marker and page text), falling back to a single-character marker built from a character absent from every representation; capture-window strings (labels, hrefs, option text, page excerpts) are redacted through a position-preserving path so the display cap can never pull a partially captured echo into view, form-encoded echoes match lowercase percent hex too, and wildcard or percent-escaped hosts in the trusted origin are rejected at configuration time.

- Text and form actions are three explicit choices instead of typing that always pressed Enter (#7). `search_eN` types the query and runs the search in one action, stamped only on structurally search-like fields (`input[type=search]` or `role=searchbox`, never by label or form heuristics), replacing the per-field action twins there. Submit controls (`button[type=submit]`, `input[type=submit]`, and a `button` with no type attribute inside a form, where it defaults to submit) are offered as `submit_eN` instead of `click_eN`. Every other single-line text field offers `type_eN` (type without submitting) alongside `submit_eN` (press Enter on that field), so filling one field of a multi-field form no longer submits it. Submit button inputs also pick up their visible label from the `value` attribute, defaulting to `Submit` when absent, and the repeat recovery no longer switches to `done`, which is a stop gate rather than an executable action.
- Public library entry: `import { navigate } from "@jkudish/jev-browser"` now works. The package root exports `navigate` and the `NavigateOptions`, `StepRecord`, `ConsoleEvent`, and `JevUsage` types side-effect free; the pre-existing `@jkudish/jev-browser/dist/navigate.js` deep import keeps working. The MCP server and CLI remain the `jev-browser` bin, and client configs are unchanged.
- Model and provider are resolved per run instead of at import time, so importing the library has no configuration side effects and concurrent runs report their own provider and model, never another run's.
- CLI recording scratch directories for `--record file.webm` are created under the OS temp directory and removed after the video is copied out, instead of leaking a `jev-browser-record-*` directory in the working directory.

## 0.4.1

- Fixed: the Chromium download now runs on install. The `postinstall` script was declared outside the `scripts` object, so npm ignored it; installs succeeded but the first run on a clean machine failed with `Executable doesn't exist`. Found and verified in clean containers by MrJev in [#6](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-browser/pull/6); `JEV_BROWSER_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` still skips the download.

## 0.4.0

- Recording support: `--record <path.webm|dir>` on the CLI and `recordDir` on `navigate()` capture a video of the page; results include `video_path` and per-step `t_ms` timestamps.
- OpenRouter typing default moved to `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`: `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` returns empty output through OpenRouter for short prompts (5/5 in testing), and the Gemini default is faster and cheaper than the alternatives measured.

## 0.3.0

- Cloudflare Workers AI support: with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (or `JEV_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` set, judgments run through Cloudflare at the `typesafe/jev` alias; `JEV_PROVIDER=cloudflare` forces it. Usage tokens are reported on every call.
- Vercel AI Gateway support: with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` set, judgments run through the AI SDK evaluate API at `typesafe-ai/jev`; `JEV_PROVIDER=vercel` forces it. Noul, choice, and score answers are adapted back to this package's shapes, with TypeSafe confidence included.
- Provider resolution order: TypeSafe direct, OpenRouter, Cloudflare, Vercel.
- Internal fix: transport branches are explicitly guarded per provider.

## 0.2.0

- OpenRouter support: with only an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, Jev judgments route through OpenRouter's Decisions API (alpha), so one OpenRouter key can power the entire package, typing included. `JEV_PROVIDER` forces `typesafe` or `openrouter`; `jev-latest` maps to `typesafe/jev-1.13` on OpenRouter.
- Results now report the transport used (`jev_provider`, resolved `model`).

## 0.1.0

Initial release, published to npm as `@jkudish/jev-browser` (the unscoped `jev-browser` name belongs to another project).

- `jev_navigate` MCP tool: task plus start URL in, final page plus step trace, captured console and network errors, usage and estimated cost, and a final screenshot out.
- One primary Jev call per step: an action Choice over up to 240 page elements plus scroll, back, and done; a goal judgment; a stuck judgment. A select action adds one second-stage Choice for its option.
- Stop gates run before action execution: agent `done`, goal probability, stuck probability, step budget (24), time budget (180 s), caller cancellation.
- Typing cascade through the Vercel AI SDK: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Google, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with a keyword fallback that is labeled in the trace.
- CLI (`jev-browser run`) and library import (`dist/navigate.js`) alongside the MCP server.
- Page payload formats: text, markdown, html, aria snapshot, with per-format caps and truncation flags.
